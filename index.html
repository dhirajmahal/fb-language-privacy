  <p>
    This application (“the App”) is a personal project created and operated by
    <strong>Dhiraj Mahal</strong> for testing and experimenting with Facebook’s Webhooks,
    AI content moderation, and automation features. The App is not intended for
    commercial use or for distribution to other users.
  </p>

  <h2>Information We Receive</h2>
  <p>The App may receive certain data from Facebook when events occur on a Facebook Page you manage, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>New comments</li>
    <li>Edited comments</li>
    <li>Hidden or deleted comments</li>
    <li>Other page feed–related webhook events</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This information is sent directly from Facebook via the Webhooks system.</p>

  <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>All data received is used only for testing and automation purposes, specifically:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Automatically classifying comments using AI models</li>
    <li>Hiding, deleting, or replying to comments based on moderation rules</li>
    <li>Logging and debugging webhook events</li>
  </ul>
  <p>No data is stored permanently and no data is shared with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The App does not store any personally identifiable information in a database
    or external storage. Webhook events may be temporarily printed to the
    developer’s local console for debugging, but no long-term storage is used.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    No data processed by the App is sold, rented, or shared with third parties.
    All processing happens locally on the developer’s machine or in the
    developer’s own cloud resources solely for testing.
  </p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>
    All communication from Facebook is received over HTTPS via a secure tunnel
    (such as ngrok). Webhook requests are verified using a secret token to
    ensure that events originate from Facebook.
  </p>

  <h2>User Rights</h2>
  <p>
    Because the App does not store personal information, there is no user data
    to access, modify, or delete. If you have concerns about any content on the
    Facebook Page itself, you may contact the Page administrator directly using
    Facebook’s tools.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is not directed toward children and does not knowingly collect
    information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
